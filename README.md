👋 Hi there 😊

I’m Hana ╰(*°▽°*)╯. I’m introduced to coding since February 2022💻. I’m currently learning html, css (bootstrap), javascript (vue.js, node js, asynchronous js, jquery), python, ui/ux (figma), kotlin📱, back-end, SQL, basic devops intro and linux.👩‍💻  I'm trying to learn a lot of thing in order to grasp my preferrences to focus on. And it means i need to try lots of things in a little bit details to have a clearer picture. Wish me luck!🥷

A Snippet on my Bio: 
- I'm dedicated and ambitious self-taught dev/coder? I like to connect with people. Lets connect🙌

What i am looking for:
- I’m looking to collaborate with github community. 
- I'm still practicing to use git correctly (ಥ_ಥ) (crying..). Git is hard but i am surviving👌. 
- Still struggling with installing ubuntu... (´。＿。｀)


Have a nice day!🌞
